## What?

A Gentoo overlay for packages I use. I push things here to sync them between my
computers, with the intention of upstreaming them to GURU. Once they're
published on GURU's main branch I remove them.

There's no guarantee that stuff here will work, so add this repository at your
own discretion. I recommend adding GURU as well if you haven't already since
that's where these packages are intended to go.

## License

I assign my copyright to Gentoo Authors. Everything here is GPLv2 licensed
like the rest of the Gentoo stuff.
