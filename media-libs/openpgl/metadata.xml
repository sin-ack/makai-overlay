		The Intel® Open Path Guiding Library (Intel® Open PGL) implements a set of
		representations and training algorithms needed to integrate path guiding
		into a renderer. Open PGL offers implementations of current state-of-the-art
		path guiding methods, which increase the sampling quality and, therefore,
		the efficiency of a renderer. The goal of Open PGL is to provide
		implementations that are well tested and robust enough to be used in a
		production environment.
